### Dark UX

Dark UX refers to user experiences that are intended to mislead or trick the user into doing something that is not in their best benefit. UXP2 defines five general strategies of Dark UX: Nagging, Obstruction, Sneaking, Interface Interference, and Forced Action.

Nagging: Nagging involves offering options more than once, in a way that prevents the user from continuing normal use of the software until they respond. An example of this is the frequently repeated suggestion to sign up for iCloud on Apple devices. 

Obstruction: 

Sneaking: 

Interface Interference: 

Forced Action: 

where is the line between effective business and "dark ux"

ethical implications - people, children, etc. Ethics != legal

### Cyber-Physical

A cyber-physical attack is a computer-based attack that is intended to cause physical damage. This is typically done by targeting electronic systems that control infrastructure such as power grids, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and water sources.

One of the most famous instances of a government cyber-physical attack is known as "Stuxnet," most likely created and deployed by the USA and Israel. Stuxnet specifically targeted hardware (SCADA) devices used in Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility. By tampering with these SCADA devices, the worm was able to destroy centrifuges in the plant.

There are huge ethical implications surrounding the use of cyber-physical attacks by governments and militaries. Stuxnet had a presice military target, but things change when the target is civilian infrastructure such as a power grid or water source. An attack like that could cause a significant loss of innocent life. Another consideration to make before deploying such an attack is this: how confident are you that your target will be the only affected system? Even more important: sre you willing to put the attack and its related exploits out into the world where they could potentially be reused or cloned by another actor? Just like the decision to deploy a nuclear strike or any military operation, it is also important to consider the potential backlash from the target and what effect it will have on the people you are tasked with protecting?
