### Dark UX

Dark UX refers to user experiences that are intended to mislead or trick the user into doing something that is not in their best benefit. UXP2 defines five general strategies of Dark UX: Nagging, Obstruction, Sneaking, Interface Interference, and Forced Action.

Nagging: Nagging involves offering options more than once, in a way that prevents the user from continuing normal use of the software until they respond. An example of this is the frequently repeated suggestion to sign up for iCloud on Apple devices. 

Obstruction: Obstruction means that a specific action is intentionally more difficut than necessary. This is done in the hopes that the user will simply give up. A prime example of this is how difficult it is to delete an Amazon Prime account. It can take an obscene number of steps, often under ambiguous labels, to stop paying for the service or remove the account.

Sneaking: Sneaking covers any intent to hide or deny important information from the user. A common example of this is hidden fees which are often displayed in a tiny font, a less-noticable color, or in an unexpected location.

Interface Interference: This involves strategically designing some interface elements to be more prominant than others, with the intent to mislead the user. This can be found in fullscreen ads, where there is a massive button to go to the relevant link, but the "x" button to close the ad is so tiny that you can barely click, especialy on a mobile device. Often you will miss the "x" and end up going to some 3rd party website.

Forced Action: Forced Action means that the user is unable to continue until they select a given option. This could, for example, include the requirnment to sign up for a newsletter before accessing normal functionality of a website or program.

It can be difficult to make ethical distinctions about Dark UX. Companies exist to make money, and many of them are providing users with free content and services. Therefore, there is nothing wrong with them attempting to persuade users with advertising and smart UX design. Ultimatley, these attampts become unethical "Dark" UX" patterns when the intent is to mislead the user into doing something they would not otherwise do if they knew what they were doing.

### Cyber-Physical

A cyber-physical attack is a computer-based attack that is intended to cause physical damage. This is typically done by targeting electronic systems that control infrastructure such as power grids, hospitals, manufacturing facilities, and water sources.

One of the most famous instances of a government cyber-physical attack is known as "Stuxnet," most likely created and deployed by the USA and Israel. Stuxnet specifically targeted hardware (SCADA) devices used in Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment facility. By tampering with these SCADA devices, the worm was able to destroy centrifuges in the plant.

There are huge ethical implications surrounding the use of cyber-physical attacks by governments and militaries. Stuxnet had a presice military target, but things change when the target is civilian infrastructure such as a power grid or water source. An attack like that could cause a significant loss of innocent life. Another consideration to make before deploying such an attack is this: how confident are you that your target will be the only affected system? Even more important: sre you willing to put the attack and its related exploits out into the world where they could potentially be reused or cloned by another actor? Just like the decision to deploy a nuclear strike or any military operation, it is also important to consider the potential backlash from the target and what effect it will have on the people you are tasked with protecting?
